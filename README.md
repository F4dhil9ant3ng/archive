# Aeonhack Archive

This project is simply another place for people to browse through Aeonhack's source code and perhaps for
the community to come together to collaborate and contribute to keeping Aeon's legacy alive.

Over the next few weeks I'll be spending time adding projects to this repo and organizing it.

I will offer no support for the code provided in this repo, as the purpose of this repo is not to fix code,
but to offer another place to download the sources from (in bulk even).

The code released in this repo and [my website](https://www.aeonhack.com) are released under the Unlicense
with permission from Taylor (Aeonhack).
